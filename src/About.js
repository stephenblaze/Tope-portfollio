    <h3 className='class'>Hi, I'm Tope.</h3>
    <div className='tasha'>You can call me a front-end developer, music enthusiast, lover of football and also a traveller.
      <p>
        I started to learn front-end developing about a year ago and i can say the experience has been wonderful, 
      though there has been some rough patches here and there.</p>
      <p>
        As a new person diving into tech, I want to define myself by the work I want to do if given the opportunity at any tech organisation. Skills can be taught,
      personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue growing, continue challenging myself, and do
      interesting things that matter.</p>
      <p>
        Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, I'm easily inspired and more than willing
        to follow my fascinations wherever they take me. I am passionate, expressive with a natural 
        ability to entertain and inspire. My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests, hobbies,
        and areas of study and artistic endeavours. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects with relative ease.
